### CocoaPods

[CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org) is a dependency manager for Cocoa projects. You can install it with the following command:

```bash
$ gem install cocoapods
```

> CocoaPods 1.2+ is required to build MovieApp.

Then, run the following command:

```bash
$ pod install
```

Open `MovieApp.xcworkspace` in Xcode.


### TMDb

[The Movie Database (TMDb)](https://www.themoviedb.org/) is a community built movie and TV database. You will need an `api_key` from  [TMDb](https://developers.themoviedb.org/3/getting-started/introduction) to get the list of movies.

Update this `api_key` in `ApiManager.swift` file in this project.
